# React Pokédex App 
This project is built using React and mongoDB for query, and sort through Pokemon.

The Pokemon data was sourced from [here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json/master/pokedex.json)

Users must create an account to access the Pokédex.
The Pokedex allows users to search by Pokemon name or filter by multiple Pokemon types.
Each Pokemon card contains information about their battle statistics.

Admins can access the admin panel to view aggregated user statistics including API request counts and individual user statistics.
